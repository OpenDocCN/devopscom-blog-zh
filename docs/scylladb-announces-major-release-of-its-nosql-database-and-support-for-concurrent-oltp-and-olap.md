*Scylla Open Source 3.0 Brings Production-Ready Materialized Views, Secondary Indexes, Cassandra 3.0 Compatibility and More***PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 6, 2018 **— ScyllaDB, the real-time big data database company, kicked off its two-day Scylla Summit by announcing a major release of its database, Scylla Open Source 3.0\. The company also previewed Scylla support for concurrent OLTP and OLAP, an industry first that enables simultaneous transactional and analytical processing. This release marks a significant milestone, as the company surpasses feature parity with Apache Cassandra, the popular open source NoSQL database. As a drop-in replacement for Apache Cassandra with as much as 10 times better performance, Scylla Open Source has added production-ready capabilities much anticipated by the NoSQL community, while introducing ground-breaking new features that improve utilization and minimize operational overhead. Scylla Open Source 3.0 features a close-to-the-hardware design that makes optimal use of modern servers. Written from the ground-up in C++ to provide significant improvements to throughput, latency and administration, Scylla delivers scale-up performance of more than 1,000,000 IOPS per node, scales out to hundreds of nodes, and consistently achieves a 99% tail latency of less than 1 millisecond.**New Scylla Capabilities Announced Today**

*   **并发 OLTP 和 OLAP:** Scylla 将使其用户能够在单个数据库集群内安全地平衡实时运营工作负载和大数据分析工作负载。在线事务处理(OLTP)和在线分析处理(OLAP)具有非常不同的数据访问特征。OLTP 涉及许多不同的小型事务，包括混合写入、更新和读取，对延迟非常敏感。相比之下，OLAP 强调跨数据集广泛扫描的吞吐量。通过引入隔离工作负载的功能，Scylla 将独一无二地同时支持 OLTP 和 OLAP 工作负载，而不会牺牲延迟或吞吐量。
*   **物化视图:** 一个期待已久的实验性特性的生产就绪版本，旨在实现服务器端表的自动化反规范化。值得注意的是，Apache Cassandra 社区在 2017 年将这一功能从生产就绪恢复到了实验模式。
*   **二级索引:** 随着 3.0 版本的发布，Scylla 的全局二级索引可以扩展到任何集群规模，这与 Apache Cassandra 采用的计数器本地索引方法不同。辅助索引允许通过非主键列查询数据。
*   **Cassandra 3.x 文件格式兼容性:** Scylla 开源 3.0 包含 Apache Cassandra 3.x 兼容存储格式(SSTable)，提升性能，存储容量减少多达 3 倍。

Speaking at Scylla Summit 2018, CEO and co-founder of ScyllaDB, Dor Laor said, “Scylla 3 represents a huge leap forward in functionality and scalability. We finally reached parity with Apache Cassandra, and developed a ground-breaking OLTP+OLAP service level agreement guarantee that puts us on a path towards pure multi-tenancy and positions us favorably against Amazon DynamoDB, Microsoft’s Cosmos DB among others.”**AVAILABILITY**Scylla Open Source 3.0 will be available in November 2018, with concurrent OLTP and OLAP support available shortly after. Existing users are encouraged to upgrade to the new version in order to take full advantage of performance gains and new capabilities. To see the advantages of Scylla:
