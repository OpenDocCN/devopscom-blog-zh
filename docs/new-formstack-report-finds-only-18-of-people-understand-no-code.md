[Formstack](https://nyl.as/t1/104/efg9caup0hg1rwo7cujypewrn/2/f647f4f4ffee0e277a7557a1c41e482413f7db4c0367bb24a85b3f3b98c47dfd), a no-code workplace productivity platform, released its inaugural report on “[The Rise of the No-Code Economy](https://nyl.as/t1/104/efg9caup0hg1rwo7cujypewrn/3/3f48dea724c4cdf603c07ebbad8e1ea78cbd0920b7e1ba8cf3c279f364b0fb9c).” The report highlights proprietary data from the company’s 2021 No-Code Economy Survey showing that despite massive growth in the no-code space since the start of 2021, no-code adoption and awareness is still relatively limited to the developer and tech community.Some of the key findings include:

*   82%的人不熟悉术语“无代码”
*   20%的人现在使用无代码工具
*   56%知道如何编写代码的人使用无代码工具
*   10%不知道如何编码的人使用无代码工具
*   81%的 IT 工作者都熟悉无代码工具的概念
*   在 IT 部门使用无代码工具的人中，有 71%是在去年采用的

Despite current adoption rates, the report also shows huge potential in the space. With exploding IT workloads and developer shortages, Gartner predicts that by 2025, 70% of new applications developed by enterprises will use low-code or no-code technologies. In line with this prediction, Formstack’s survey found that 33% of people across industries expect to increase no-code usage over the next year, with 45% in computer & electronics manufacturing, 46% in banking and finance, and 71% in software. The survey also found that 66% of respondents have adopted no-code tools in just the last year and 41% in the last six months, suggesting COVID-19 has driven growth across the industry that could exceed Gartner’s expectations.“No-code is creating a new revolution in tech (and the world) because it’s giving the power of software development to the masses. It’s no longer the small percentage of the world that can code that can develop their idea. Now anyone with an internet connection can build software. Think of all the ideas and solutions we’re missing because it’s been inaccessible to develop software,” said Lacey Kesler, Head of Education at Adalo and Founder of Women in No-Code.In addition to growing usage rates, many believe their organizations and industries will begin hiring for no-code roles within the next year, showing that the no-code economy is not just limited to the tools but is instead creating an entirely new industry of workers.For more information, you can check out the interactive report [here](https://nyl.as/t1/104/efg9caup0hg1rwo7cujypewrn/4/f6a7a375b56c6dc7f4a4465f106143e55f5154a84f58155ea0c69ceaddbfc494).

External sources and data points are included throughout the report to further define and explain the no-code economy.
