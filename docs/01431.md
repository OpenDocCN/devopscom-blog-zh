# **Highly Available and Flexible SSD-Based Storage Enables Teams of Developers to Scale Production Workloads, Add Disk Space, and Build Distributed Applications Without Changing Droplet Size**NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwired – Jul 13, 2016) – DigitalOcean, provider of the cloud computing platform designed for developers, today released Block Storage, the number one product request from customers. Block Storage is a highly available and scalable SSD-based offering that will enable developers to easily attach extra disk space to DigitalOcean Droplets (cloud servers). DigitalOcean’s Block Storage costs $0.10/GB per month and is based on provisioned capacity only, therefore there is no need for complicated formulas to determine the overall cost for transactions or IOPs limit.DigitalOcean was founded in 2011 with the mission to simplify the complexities of infrastructure by offering one simple and robust platform for developers to easily launch and scale their applications. The company has taken a “developer first” mentality and is now evolving its platform to further support the business needs of the developer. DigitalOcean has become the second largest and fastest growing cloud computing platform in the total number of public facing apps and websites, according to Netcraft. More than 700,000 registered customers have launched more than 18 million Droplets combined on DigitalOcean, nearly doubling from 10 million six months ago.“We set out on a mission to build a simple and robust cloud computing platform so that engineering teams can spend less time configuring and automating their infrastructure and more time focused on software development,” said Ben Uretsky, co-founder and CEO, DigitalOcean. “By adding a highly performant Block Storage offering to our platform, developers can easily deploy and manage their SaaS applications and businesses as they scale. This is one step closer to building the next generation platform.”**The Easiest Way for Developers to Attach and Scale Storage to Support Their Businesses and Applications**Block Storage is a complementary product to DigitalOcean’s Droplets, which provide compute power and local storage, by making them more expandable and flexible. By attaching Block Storage to DigitalOcean Droplets via the control panel or API, developers can achieve the following benefits:

*   **高可用性**:块存储将数据存储在与 Droplet 分离的硬件上，在不同的机架上多次复制数据，减少硬件故障时数据丢失的几率。
*   **可扩展且灵活**:开发人员可以轻松地将基于 SSD 的块存储卷从 1GB 扩展到 16TB，并在不同的 Droplets 之间移动。将额外的块存储附加到 Droplets 的能力极大地提高了它们的灵活性，使开发人员能够扩展应用程序、数据库、二进制资产、共享和分布式文件系统等。
*   **可靠安全**:所有数据在静止状态下都经过加密，并通过隔离网络传输到液滴。

**Supporting Quotes**

*   GitLab 开发人员 Patricio Cano 说:“对于大型团队或处理大量数据的团队来说，存储是一个非常现实的挑战。存储资产总是会占用大量空间，这通常会迫使人们优先考虑他们想要存储的内容，或者为每个额外的存储单元花费越来越多的钱。以 GitLab 的 GitHost 为例，在没有块存储的情况下，一个实例拥有的磁盘空间量与客户选择的计划联系在一起。有了块存储，客户现在可以根据团队的需求(RAM 和处理器的数量)选择正确的计划，而不必担心有限的磁盘空间，因为他们现在可以添加多达 16TB 的额外存储。对于 GitLab 和我们的客户来说，这是一个好消息。我们很高兴看到块存储与 Git LFS 的结合将使用户能够轻松存储和版本控制他们的文件。”
*   Mesosphere 联合创始人兼首席架构师 Benjamin Hindman 表示:“所有平台的开发人员都想要简单、高性能的云存储，就像 DigitalOcean 通过其新的块存储服务提供的那样。我们很高兴能与 DigitalOcean 合作，成为开源 DC/操作系统存储兴趣小组的一员，努力为 DC/操作系统用户提供块存储，并改善开发人员的整体存储体验。”
