*New features accelerate enterprise infrastructure automation and enable continuous enforcement of security and governance policies across hybrid cloud environments***NORTH BETHESDA, MD, October 29, 2020 —** [CloudBolt Software](https://www.cloudbolt.io/), the enterprise leader in cloud management and integration solutions, today announced the general availability of [OneFuse 1.1](https://www.cloudbolt.io/onefuse/), a codeless integration platform for automating, extending and integrating hybrid cloud technologies. This release provides powerful new capabilities to help IT to simplify integration complexity across their cloud management, infrastructure-as-code, and automation platforms including VMware vRealize Automation and HashiCorp Terraform. By enabling IT to easily create deep, feature-rich integrations—without the high cost and complexity of custom code—enterprises can accelerate their infrastructure automation initiatives while improving governance and compliance.“As enterprises invest in digital transformation, accelerating their automation initiatives for hybrid cloud is hampered by the sheer complexity of integrations across IT and DevOps tools,” said Jeff Kukowski, chief executive officer of CloudBolt Software. “Integrations should be accelerators, not stumbling blocks. Enterprises continue to find themselves tripping over custom code when integrating their scripts and platforms like VMware vRealize Automation and Terraform with underlying IT, networking and security infrastructure. OneFuse 1.1 dramatically accelerates time-to-value by reducing this custom code and improving integration governance, all through a codeless, policy-based approach.”**The OneFuse Advantage**Traditional infrastructure automation tools rely on custom coding and unsupported integration methods that can often be error-prone and ungoverned. According to the Standish Group, custom coding software projects is both expensive (52% of custom coded projects cost 189% of their original estimate) and time-consuming (organizations cancel 19% of their custom software projects). OneFuse 1.1 is a software-defined alternative to siloed custom integration services. As an enterprise integration platform purpose-built for hybrid cloud, OneFuse 1.1 has three distinct advantages over alternative integration methods. The platform enables:

*   **无代码集成—**one fuse 1.1 具有一个中间件抽象层，其中包含生产就绪型集成逻辑，允许 IT 部门将其配置、编排或自动化工具与目标基础架构端点(例如 IPAM、DNS 等)进行无代码集成。).OneFuse 还扩展了现有平台 VMware vRealize Automation 和 Terraform 的集成功能，因此客户能够从这些投资中获得更多价值。通过消除对定制集成的需求，OneFuse 为昂贵的专业服务提供了替代方案，价值在几天内而不是几个月或几年内实现。

*   **集中治理和合规性—**通过 OneFuse 的集中控制台，企业可以轻松定义、应用和实施基础架构部署和使用策略，无需特殊工具或技能。这使 IT 部门能够针对多个供应商的服务和组件实施监控、合规性、安全性、审计和日志记录要求。OneFuse 使他们能够看到谁、什么、何时以及如何消耗和部署资源和服务，并始终拥有所有请求、工作成果、用户和策略的完整审计跟踪。

*   **统一自动化**–许多企业 IT 组织是孤立和分散的，这影响了实现良好治理的高级自动化的能力。OneFuse 通过允许不同的角色(例如，基础架构工程师、自动化架构师、站点可靠性工程师等)来消除这些障碍。)在集成和自动化策略上进行协作，而无需提供对 IT 系统的特权访问。它可以快速、经济高效且安全地统一云资源的调配和编排，同时为任何需要的人提供对这些服务的“随时随地”的访问。

“Today, many of our customers are investing in digital transformation and hybrid cloud in order to maintain a competitive edge. As more IT and DevOps tools proliferate in the enterprise, we’ve seen a growing interest in the adoption of technologies such as OneFuse because they offer fast time-to-value for integrations, centralize policies for improved governance, and free up resources to focus on more transformative business objectives,” said John Tejada, Global Technical Solutions Architect, World Wide Technology. OneFuse 1.1 is now generally available with naming services, IP address management (IPAM), domain name system (DNS), and Microsoft Active Directory support for platforms including vRealize Automation and HashiCorp Terraform.
