Many companies rapidly adopting FinOps but are at the early stages of optimizing cloud spendPORTLAND, Ore. – February 3, 2021 – Big growth is ahead for FinOps, the field of cloud financial management, as more companies accelerate their cloud plans, especially amid COVID-19, and struggle to contain and optimize cloud spend, new research indicates.The FinOps Foundation, a non-profit trade association focused on codifying and promoting cloud financial management best practices and standards, recently surveyed over 800  FinOps practitioners from around the world with a collective $45 billion in annual cloud spend. Almost half of the survey respondents were from companies with 10,000 or more employees, indicating that large companies are driving FinOps adoption.The survey underscores that FinOps is experiencing big growth but that there is much work ahead. Key survey findings include:

*   近一半的调查受访者(49%)很少或没有管理云支出的自动化，而这是 FinOps 实践的核心原则之一。

*   在有一些自动化的企业中，几乎三分之一的企业会自动通知(31%)和标记卫生(29%)。)只有 13%的自动化规模调整和 9%的现场使用，这表明企业很可能错过了优化云支出的机会。

*   公共云计算支出的一半用于按需服务，这是价格最高的服务，49%用于保留、节约或承诺使用，这是第二昂贵的选择。只有 13%的人选择了即时使用，这是最便宜的服务，尽管被调查者认为 28%的人是这一选择的“优秀”目标。

*   40%的受访者认为让工程师进行成本优化是最大的挑战，其次是处理共同成本(33%)和准确预测支出(26%)。)

*   只有 15%的受访者表示他们的 FinOps 实践处于成熟的“运行”阶段，这意味着他们可以不断改进已建立的实践。10 家公司中有 4 家处于“行走”阶段，核心流程正在运行，但仍有许多成熟的流程，44%的公司处于“爬行”阶段，刚刚入门。

“The dirty little secret of cloud spend is that the bill never really goes down,” says J.R. Storment, executive director of the FinOps Foundation. “Smart companies use the cloud to move quickly and outperform their competitors. While agility is paramount, they also want maximum business value for the investment.”FinOps is clearly an area more companies will invest in. The survey respondents predicted an over 40% growth in FinOps team size in the next 12 months.By learning more about the challenges and opportunities facing FInOps practitioners, the Foundation, which just added Google Cloud as a Premier Member, can better create educational and informative content to help the community.“The survey underscores that the challenges faced by large companies—cost, complexity of billing data, the changing nature of the cloud—are surprisingly similar to those faced by small companies,” Storment notes. “This supports the notion that developing FinOps best practices early on will pay huge dividends as cloud use and costs grow. The FinOps Foundation is perfectly positioned to help enable these best practices with our work in such areas as frameworks, benchmarking data, and certifications.”For more survey insights, including around such topics of top challenges, team structure, capabilities, KPIs, and primary needs, access the report [here](http://data.finops.org/).About the FinOps FoundationThe [FinOps Foundation](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.finops.org%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpr%26utm_medium%3Dpress%252520release%26utm_campaign%3Dmomentum&esheet=52000641&newsitemid=20190617005720&lan=en-US&anchor=FinOps+Foundation&index=9&md5=d21f42b055c7a30c47696f46e71db2cf) (F2) is a non-profit trade association made up of FinOps practitioners around the world including Atlassian, Autodesk, Gannett, HERE Technologies, Just Eat, Nationwide and Spotify.
