> 
> This new free asset was conceived from a survey after Prey team saw the problems and difficulties raised by users and IT community in this unexpected large-scale remote work transfer process.

> The team reviewed the main problems that need to be solved in these situations, and determined the following points: The vast majority of communities need to know the location of equipment assigned by the company for remote work. The second problem is to maintain the basic responsibility of the workers responsible for each piece of equipment. Third, 50% of the consulted users believe that if the connection is unsafe, improperly protected or open, network information is necessary to implement mitigation measures.
