Its Winter 21 release unleashes the value locked inside digital transformation projects by redefining the way companies plan, build, and deliver customer experiences with Salesforce. With new major innovations across all five DevOps stages, Copado Winter 21 enables customers to accelerate Salesforce time-to-value and demonstrate positive business value within 100 days.Today’s digital imperative means software delivery performance is the leading indicator of a company’s ability to deliver business results.

Project risk is mitigated with increased governance and compliance resulting in 94% fewer production bugs, 192% faster time to recover, and thousands of delivery hours saved per year.“Companies are laser focused on accelerating their digital-first projects because of the exponential impact on real business results,” said Sanjay Gidwani, chief operating officer at Copado. “Value stream management is the new must-have for anyone under pressure to meet executive expectations on the speed, quality and visibility of technology investments.
