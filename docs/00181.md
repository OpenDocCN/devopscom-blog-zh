Evan Powell, its co-founder and CEO, has been keeping a diary, because the company is ready to emerge from stealth. In the next few days, as a new DevOps company enters the market, we will share Powell's thoughts and experiences.*

在接下来的几篇文章中，我将分享我对为什么仍然需要 StackStorm(一家专注于基于 DevOps 的自动化的新公司)的想法。我的第一个评论是，用户将决定我们如何重叠或补充现有的自动化解决方案。到目前为止，他们证实了我们的信念——我们与厨师、木偶，当然还有 CF 引擎和最近的 Salt 等开拓者有很强的互补性。我们的方法是专注于将数据中心连接在一起的运营自动化，对于像脸书的 FBAR 和我们自己的 beta 级软件这样的系统，这种自动化会随着时间的推移而学习。以此为背景，在接下来的五天里，我将为我们揭开开始 [StackStorm](http://www.stackstorm.com) 的关键驱动因素——从我认为 DevOps.com 的所有读者都应该同意的事情开始:

**DevOps and the shift to the cloud is much bigger than generally assumed.** Over the last few years, my co-founder Dmitri and I have met with thousands of enterprises, service providers, government agencies, integrators and sundry analysts and experts. And I’ve been speaking about the inevitability of the shift to Software Defined Data Centers for many years while helping to create the software defined storage market as founding CEO of Nexenta Systems. More recently, as StackStormers, Dmitri and I have met with approximately 100 DevOps practitioners with OpenStack projects either ongoing or kicking off. The shift to DevOps – sometimes lumped in with the shift to Software Defined Data Centers and also the shift to the cloud – is the biggest shift in IT we’ve seen in our careers. The top DevOps practitioners are 10-100x more productive than your legacy siloed IT operations department. Software is “eating everything” AND the approach to building and operating software has improved radically. Nearly every company and government in the world must either leverage this step function improvement in productivity of software development and operations or face disruption. It might be worth discussing the 10-100x productivity improvement:**a. Is it real? **Organizations like PayPal and eBay have published their own data showing at least a 7x improvement in development velocity. And of course the DevOps surveys by folks like Puppet Labs have shown even higher improvements in the speed and quality of development. And, again, our own experience indicates it is very real.  One operator tells us that they went from building and deploying 1 new service a year before DevOps to 54 in the 12 months after they got up to speed with a DevOps approach. Revolutionary.**b. Is 10x a lot? **Software getting built **and operated** 10x better is changing the world. A comparison that Dmitri made in his talk at [SCALE12x this past February](http://www.slideshare.net/StackStorm/scale-12x-openstack-vs-vmware-a-system) was to the tractor. As I think any casual student of the 20th century knows, the tractor changed the world by enabling urbanization and more. According to most economic historians, the tractor was about 4x more productive as measured by crops produced vs. input in human and machine energy. IT fairly suddenly figuring out how to develop and operate software 10-100x more productively compares favorably with the most important improvements in human history.![horse-tractor-1](../Images/06057abc66d587f58c073a0fe29ca862.png)So – GREAT. The world is changing. What do we and other DevOps solution providers have to do with this? Ask yourself – why don’t we ALL just jump on the DevOps bandwagon and start building **and operating** software in this new way? I’ll take on that question tomorrow as the second driver that led us to start StackStorm.Feedback welcome.  Comment below please.**DevOps and the shift to the cloud is much bigger than generally assumed.** Over the last few years, my co-founder Dmitri and I have met with thousands of enterprises, service providers, government agencies, integrators and sundry analysts and experts.
