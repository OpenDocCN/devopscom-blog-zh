# DevOpsDays MSP 2015:明尼阿波利斯是科技中心？

> 原文:[https://devo PS . com/devo psdays-MSP-2015-明尼阿波利斯-tech-hub/](https://devops.com/devopsdays-msp-2015-minneapolis-tech-hub/)

今年早些时候，我在明尼阿波利斯机场转机。鉴于明尼阿波利斯以冰雪闻名，我从未花太多时间去想它。我从来没有计划去那里，也没有明确地计划避开它。那是在 devopsdays MSP 的阵容出来之前。

I remembered seeing videos from the previous year and being mildly surprised they had such a seasoned lineup. When the speakers were announced I wasn’t expecting to see such a solid group of presenters taking the stage again. I like going to events in cities with a thriving tech industry. It always makes for a good hallway track when a lot of sharp folks are in the area and can easily attend. So what were all these people doing in Minneapolis?
It ends up a lot of tech heavy companies are in the area. Target, US Bank, Cargill, General Mills, Best Buy, Land O’ Lakes, and 3M are among them. None of these are pure tech companies like I would expect to find around San Francisco, but any company that’s competitive these days is probably leveraging a lot of technology in an effort to better serve their customers and keep things running smoothly behind the scenes. If you know anything about what I’ve been doing with CookieOps it should be no surprise I was thrilled to see technology applied to traditional business models so enthusiastically.
Target not only sponsored the event but had employees show up in force, fully engaged. 2nd place highlight for this event was discussing devOps, agile, and lean principles with Mary and Tom Poppendieck, authors of [Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321150783/poppendieckco-20), along with a group of folks from Target. Mary’s talk, [“The New New Software Game”](https://youtu.be/K2_yPtAB7Lw) focused on techniques that make it possible for small teams to deploy small changes to large systems very rapidly and very safely. More specifically, this was a talk on how to break monolithic systems into micro services. I really appreciated how her talk highlighted human interaction and how it incorporates with technology.
Getting to listen to Mary and Tom talk shop with Target was incredible. They mentioned the shelf life of software on more than one occasion, and I may have gotten a little light headed when Mary used a cookie company as an example of a manufacturing process that’s deeply concerned with time to market.
The top highlight of the event for me had to be Daniel Willis’s ignite talk, [“Sports Stats 101: Putting the R in Sports”](https://youtu.be/qAMu5dRDmGA?t=31). As a mathematician and a father I think getting kids into technology early is one of the best things we can do for them. When I saw Daniel was giving a talk on baseball stats in R at the age of 12 I had no choice but to make plans for Minneapolis. Daniel didn’t disappoint either, cracking standard deviation jokes in his bow tie in front of a crowd of about 400 people.
Colleen Velo’s talk, [“Rolling Your Own vs SaaS”](https://youtu.be/se32sXCKb9g) covered the tradeoffs between internally coding solutions, using open source software, and running infrastructure in the public cloud. Bloom Health, another Minneapolis business, is in the high risk environment of healthcare. I found Colleen’s perspective and experience on this subject to be extremely relevant given the new security challenges we’re facing in our industry and the trouble that higher risk sectors are having with innovation as a result of it. I wasn’t surprised to hear Bloom is moving to SaltStack giving the risk associated with the industry where they operate.
I also encourage you to take a look at Josh Zimmerman’s presentation on [“Why You Should Care about DevOps in the Public Sector”](https://youtu.be/se32sXCKb9g). Public sector IT employees face a different set of problems with respect to structure, motivation, and funding. DevOps has moved from startups towards the enterprise, but there’s still a lot of good these practices can do to solve problems in the public sector where much of the resistance can be attributed to the need for a cultural change. Josh and I had a chance to talk about the cultural perspective of libraries, and how they’re viewed as places to keep books instead of places to keep information. I try to check out a library when I’m in a new town and see if they have anything interesting in the archives. This trip landed me in the [Minneapolis Central Library](http://www.hclib.org/about/locations/minneapolis-central) where I was able to look at an early edition of Walden that included signed letters from Henry David Thoreau. There’s a lot of good stuff at the Hennepin County Central Library including a Dunn Bros Coffee on the first floor, a Teen Tech Center sponsored by Best Buy, art exhibits, and even a sound proof piano room. I stayed in Special Collections the entire time  I was there, but if you’re in Minneapolis it’s definitely worth stopping by.

我还在空地上向小组介绍了绘画游戏。你先在一张空白页上随意涂鸦，然后把纸和笔传给每个人，让他们给这幅画添加一些东西。在停下来之前，我们绕着我们的空地转了两圈，最后得到了下图。这个游戏是任何一群等着吃饭的人的救命稻草，尤其是如果你有孩子的话。一个备用的餐垫和一支从工作人员那里借来的笔已经为我抵挡了数不清的更多的蹒跚学步的孩子的崩溃。即使你只是看着场景展开，对大孩子和成年人来说也很有趣。

那么，这一切是如何在明尼阿波利斯结束的呢？就 devopsdays MSP 而言，我非常感谢布里奇特·克罗姆胡特。很明显，她在 devOps 社区投入了大量时间，并且没有忘记在自己的后院帮助建立一个强大的社区。食物、衬衫、活动宣传、AV，甚至[活动网站上的幻灯片和视频](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-minneapolis/program/)都可以追溯到她和其他出色的工作人员。布里奇特承诺在纽约时会举办一场精彩的活动，但当她开始谈论明尼阿波利斯温暖的天气时，我怀疑她可能会有所偏袒。我可以直接确认明尼阿波利斯一年到头都不下雪，而 devopsdays MSP 发生在一年中最适合参观的时候。
我们离匹兹堡的 [devopsdays 只有两个星期了，我期待着参加这个活动，第一次访问这个城镇，在访问一些更熟悉的人的同时认识一些新面孔。由于明尼阿波利斯、布里奇特和整个 MSP 工作人员，我的期望相当高。匹兹堡也是科技中心吗？](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2015-pittsburgh/)
