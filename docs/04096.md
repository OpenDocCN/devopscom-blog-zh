SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – August 29, 2017 – CollabNet (www.collabnet.com), a global leader in enterprise software development, release automation and DevOps solutions, today announced its latest release of TeamForge, the award-winning Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and enterprise version control platform.

CollabNet has been successfully providing those abilities to organizations for years. When cross-functional teams share a virtual workspace and can view and trace the value of individual contributions to an initiative, empathy and continuous feedback are natural next steps.”

Now releasing version 17.8, CollabNet consistently strives to respond to customer feedback and ensure that users have optimal flexibility and functionality while using the platform.
