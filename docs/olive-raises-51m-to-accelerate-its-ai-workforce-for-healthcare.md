Paulus said, "As the recent CEO of the health system, I understand the pressure that our hospitals are facing, because they focus on providing the best possible patient care in a challenging environment, and at the same time need to keep normal operation. "Olive's reliable automation of basic back-office processes saves time, reduces errors, and enables employees to focus on higher-level work. I'm glad to work closely with Olive's management team to maximize our great positive impact in the administrative and clinical aspects of health care. "
