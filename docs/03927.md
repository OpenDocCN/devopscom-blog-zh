Twilio, Lyft, Yext, GitHub and DigitalOcean All Rely On LightStep [x]PM In ProductionSan Francisco, CA – November 14, 2017 – Today at Structure 2017, LightStep comes out of stealth and formally introduces its first product, LightStep [x]PM. LightStep [x]PM is the first performance management solution to apply APM’s core value proposition – monitoring and troubleshooting performance issues – across all components of today’s software applications: web and mobile clients, monoliths, microservices, both on premises and in the cloud. LightStep gives an accurate, detailed snapshot across the entire complex software system at any given point in time, enabling organizations to identify bottlenecks and resolve incidents rapidly.Today LightStep also announced $29 million in funding from Sequoia, Redpoint and others.LightStep was founded in 2015 to address challenges faced by enterprises building complex software. Introducing microservices has accelerated software development, but these additional services bring greater operational complexity and a dramatic increase in the volume of diagnostic data, making performance management a challenge. The existing APM solutions fail to scale or to provide accurate insights in real-time since ordinary transactions can involve dozens to thousands of distinct services.LightStep [x]PM addresses these challenges with a unique, decentralized architecture that continuously analyzes 100% of transactions across all services, in production. This lets customers measure performance wherever it impacts their business: distinct microservices, key mobile transitions, crucial customer accounts, or individual end-users. When LightStep [x]PM’s statistical engine detects an anomaly, it replays and records a detailed end-to-end trace. This trace provides the cross-service context needed to resolve an incident or identify a performance problem.Customers on LightStep [x]PMLightStep [x]PM customers take seconds or minutes to resolve incidents that previously required days of ongoing, multi-team firefighting. The product has led to massive performance improvements in key end-user experiences for both web and mobile.

*   Twilio 借助 LightStep 将事件解决时间缩短了 92%。Twilio SVP 平台 Jason Hudak 表示:“LightStep [x]PM 不仅能发现我们的性能问题，还能告诉我们为什么会出现这些问题。在运行 LightStep 的一个小时内，我们的计费交易团队就能够发现问题并进行改进，从而将延迟减少了 70%。LightStep 帮助我晚上睡得更好，因为我知道我们的工程师将能够实时识别和修复问题，保持客户对 Twilio 的信任。"
*   Yext 使用 LightStep 监控顶级客户，以提供一流的体验。Yext 工程副总裁 Rob Figueiredo 表示:“有了 LightStep，我们拥有了性能全知。它实时提供统计数据和详细的跟踪信息，并按客户进行细分。它确保我们兑现对客户的承诺。”
*   Lyft 通过 LightStep 从整体架构转向分布式架构。Lyft 工程副总裁皮特·莫雷利表示:“LightStep 是监控的未来，在我们转向微服务的过程中发挥了重要作用。我们的系统每天产生超过 1000 亿次微服务调用。LightStep 是仅有的能够理解这种消防水带的系统之一:它跳到了性能问题的根本原因，从移动设备一直到我们分布式堆栈的底部。”

LightStep Data SourcesThere are many ways to integrate with LightStep [x]PM, and customers combine them to gain full coverage of their software systems:

*   与 OpenTracing 的本机集成，open tracing 是由 LightStep 的首席执行官和联合创始人 Ben Sigelman 以及 OSS 跟踪社区中的其他人共同创建的 CNCF 成员项目和开放 API 标准
*   来自多个来源的现有集中测井数据
*   服务网格技术和负载平衡器，如 Envoy、linkerd、nginx、haproxy 等

“Today’s production applications do not come from a single mold,” said Daniel Conde, Analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group. “There will be microservices as well as monolithic applications, and deployments will be on bare metal services and on hybrid cloud platforms. These need to co-exist and integrate with each other, so a modern application performance monitoring solution needs to gather data from across the enterprise with all of these models. LightStep [x]PM meets those needs with a modern solution that examines application performance end-to-end, across all of these diagnostic data sources and ultimately enable rapid problem resolution.”“I have seen software development change rapidly in the last decade, and I believe we are entering a new era,” said Ben Sigelman, co-founder and CEO at LightStep. “Today, enterprise IT and engineering leaders preside over complex, business-critical software applications that operate at a daunting scale. We built LightStep to deliver products, beginning with LightStep [x]PM, that cut through the complexity of today’s production software and keep our customers in control.”Sigelman is an expert in performance analysis and debugging in large software systems. He designed and deployed global-scale monitoring technologies at Google, including Dapper, an always-on distributed tracing system which analyzes more than 2 billion transactions per second.
