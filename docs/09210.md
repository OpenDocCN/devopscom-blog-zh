*Acquisition of ChaosNative– Original Creator of CNCF Project LitmusChaos–  ** Expands Harness Software Delivery Platform With Chaos Engineering Capabilities to Help Enterprises Achieve Resiliency Goals**New Module, Harness Service Reliability Management (SRM), Embeds Service Level Objectives (SLOs) in the CI/CD Pipeline so Developer Teams Move Faster While Assuring Unreliable Code Doesn’t Get to Production**New Module, Harness Security Testing Orchestration (STO), Automates Security Scanning and Governance to Fix Vulnerabilities Before Deployment***San Francisco, CA, March 22, 2022—**[Harness](https://harness.io/) Inc., the software delivery platform company, today announced major platform expansions with the acquisition of [ChaosNative Inc.](https://www.chaosnative.com/), the original creator of the popular [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF) open source project [LitmusChaosTM](https://litmuschaos.io/), and provider of ChaosNative LitmusTM, the highly scalable and secure enterprise platform for chaos engineering. Harness also launched two new modules to enable developers to more rapidly deliver reliable and secure software.[Harness Service Reliability Management](https://harness.io/products/service-reliability-management) (SRM) module enables teams to adopt modern software reliability practices, using SLOs to actively govern the software delivery lifecycle (SDLC). As the first solution to actively manage SLOs in CI/CD pipelines, Harness SRM helps reliability teams eliminate the friction that comes from reliability issues like SLO violations or low error budgets. These problems force engineering teams to focus on stabilizing services, or even stopping deployments altogether, rather than on their core charter—adding new features at velocity to drive business value.[Harness Security Testing Orchestration](https://harness.io/products/security-testing-orchestration) (STO) module helps enterprises deliver business value more quickly by increasing security in deployments and reducing vulnerabilities and conflicting aims between developer and security teams in the software deployment process. Harness STO not only eliminates the pain and risk of manually tracking security issues, but minimizes the rework that delays deployment.ChaosNative’s chaos engineering capabilities will be available in the Harness platform this quarter. Harness SRM and Harness STO are both tightly integrated with the Harness Software Delivery Platform. Customers can deploy each module independently with their existing tooling or use all of the Harness modules together to build a powerful, unified modern software delivery pipeline that spans CI, CD, Feature Flags, Cloud Cost Management, SRM, STO and Chaos Engineering.“Developers are under intense pressure to deliver highly resilient, secure and reliable software with velocity to increase business value, grow revenue, and delight end users. However, reliability, resiliency and velocity have been seen as conflicting goals– and the toil and stress of attempting to optimize for all degrades the developer experience,” said Jyoti Bansal, CEO, Harness. “With the acquisition of ChaosNative and the addition of Harness SRM and Harness STO, the Harness platform bridges the chasm of velocity, resiliency, reliability and security, empowering developers to rapidly and reliably deliver on business objectives while providing an unmatched developer experience.”**Harness Chaos Engineering Brings the Power of Chaos Engineering to the Harness Software Delivery Platform**Harness is integrating ChaosNative Litmus into the Harness Software Delivery platform, providing customers with a proven chaos engineering solution. Harness Chaos Engineering improves application reliability across distributed environments, tracks reliability improvements, avoids costly unplanned downtime, reduces mean time to resolution (MTTR), and provides a better end-user experience for customers. Combining ChaosNative’s advanced testing capabilities with Harness’s software delivery platform enables developer teams to take control of their service reliability. The acquisition of ChaosNative is complete and the integration will be generally available this quarter.**Harness SRM Solves the Problem of Balancing Velocity With Reliability **Engineers and reliability teams ultimately share the same goal: protecting their organization from downtime and reputation damage resulting from unreliable deployments, while delivering value and new features to end users as rapidly as possible. The two teams must balance the needs of software engineers striving to deliver software faster to achieve business value with reliability teams prioritizing cautious deployments to avoid rollbacks and maximize uptime. Both velocity and reliability are required to achieve customer satisfaction, so Harness SRM offers a solution to:

1.  通过自动化流程，减少手动跟踪服务水平指标(sli)、SLO 和错误预算的工作量。
2.  通过在软件开发的每个阶段提供质量和可靠性反馈，以及可靠性检查(如错误跟踪和延迟分析),实现高可靠性软件的部署。
3.  通过建立可靠性防护栏，在确保不可靠的代码不会进入生产的同时，给予开发团队更快行动的自由。

This can accelerate time to market because potential problems are discovered and fixed before they reach deployment, where the security team would normally discover them. Moreover, detecting vulnerabilities in development, prior to deployment, can significantly reduce rework required when security teams discover vulnerabilities in deployment, which risks slowing time to market for new apps and features.Harness STO:

1.  通过在整个 CI/CD 渠道中自动执行主动安全扫描和治理，实现高度安全软件的交付。
2.  使用策略作为代码和开放策略代理，使 DevSecOps 团队能够定制治理配置并建立一致的策略和程序。
3.  通过对来自所有扫描仪的海量数据进行标准化、重复数据删除和关联，消除耗时的手动分析，提供按优先级排列的漏洞列表。
