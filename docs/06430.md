Copado is the only solution for Salesforce delivery performance and management, all built natively on the Salesforce platform. With Copado, organizations can now align people, process and goals to quickly and confidently deliver digital customer experiences on the Salesforce platform.”DevOps 360 AnalyticsCopado DevOps 360 Analytics, the first Salesforce DevOps analytics performance platform, delivers real-time visibility and analytics to any Salesforce project to optimize the planning, build and delivery of innovation. It brings together all the DevOps data from Salesforce into a collaborative DevOps platform that tracks the innovation delivery performance of a Salesforce project. With Copado DevOps 360, organizations can measure Salesforce ROI, accelerate release cycles, deliver safer releases, adapt to changing market conditions and align business goals with technology.“The pace of innovation today is insanely fast; software is constantly improving with new updates to address today’s insatiable thirst for digital experiences,” said R “Ray” Wang, Principal Analyst, Founder and Chairman of Constellation Research Inc. “Salesforce is the go-to platform for building the best customer experiences and organizations building on that platform need to ensure they are constantly and accurately evaluating the performance of the delivery process. Companies need to transform their business during these uncertain times and they seek an optimized and measurable DevOps solution that leads to faster release cycles and higher quality releases. DevOps is no longer optional for companies who must compete in today’s economic environment.”Copado DevOps 360 quantifies the success of transformation based on the speed and quality of innovation delivery. Beyond the standard reports and dashboards capability within Salesforce, Copado tracks the full history of metrics for each development item, providing in-depth analysis of future performance issues before they can happen. It allows organizations to align and collaborate around value delivery, gain visibility into the development lifecycle, identify and remove bottlenecks, and deliver more predictable, higher quality releases.Specifically, Copado DevOps 360 uses embedded Tableau analytics to show planning performance, development performance, delivery performance, CIO dashboards and value stream maps. Value stream maps provide clear and actionable insights into the development process, displaying stages, processes within stages and metrics associated with the processes.DevOps Expert EcosystemAs part of Summer 20, Copado has also launched the first Salesforce DevOps exchange, a marketplace in the Copado ecosystem.
